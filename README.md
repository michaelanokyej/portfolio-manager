# Portfolio Manager

## Problem

> Updating my portfolio always requires me to go into my code and actually update it. 
> To save time, I have created this manager as a helper to manage my updates to my 
> portolio since I will be updating blog every few days.
> This manager updates my portfolio database with blogs and projects which my portfolio client can fetch.

#### Technology Used

> React, JavaScript, CSS, NPM
> [Check out my Portfolio](https://michaelanokyej.github.io/portfolio-manager/ "Link to Portfolio Manager screen").
